Question: Consider a probability distribution in which the random variable $X$ can only take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Suppose that $P(X = 2) = 0.25$, $P(X = 3) = 0.05$, and $P(X = 4) = 0.05$.

Which of the following must be true?

Choices:
- $P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.9$
- $P(X = 0) + P(X = 3) = 0.15$
- $P(X = 0) = P(X = 2)$

Question: An insurance company issues an annual policy on a small boat under the following four situations. The replacement cost of $13,000 will be paid out for a total loss. If it is not a total loss, but the damage is at least $8,000, then $5,200 will be paid out. There will be no money paid out if there is damage but it is less than $8,000. Of course, nothing will be paid out if there is no damage. The insurance company estimates the probabilities of the above four situations to be 0.09, 0.18, 0.43, and 0.3, respectively. How much should the insurance company charge annually for this policy if it wants to make a profit of $50 above the expected amount paid out in a year?
