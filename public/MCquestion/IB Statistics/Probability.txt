Question: A fair die, with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, is rolled four times. "Fair" implies that each face is equally likely to turn up each time the die is rolled. After each roll, the number appearing on the upturned face is recorded. Which of the following sets below is a valid sample space for the experiment?

Choices:
- S = {more than three 4's, fewer than four 4's}
- S = {more 4's than 3's, fewer 4's than 3's}
- S = {an even number of 4's, at least one 4}
- S = {an odd number of 4's, no more than one 4}

Question: Consider the following six-sided dice. The value for each of the 6 faces for each die is given in the table below:
![](/questionPic/prob_3.jpg?400x)
For example: Die A has 6 sides. Two of the sides have a 0, and four of the sides have a 4. Each of the 6 sides is equally likely to turn up on any roll.
Suppose that there are 4 players, each choosing a die. Each player must choose a different die and they will roll it one time. The player who rolls the largest number observed on a single roll will win the game. Player one chooses first, then player two chooses, and so on. For each die, calculate the probability that the largest number observed occurs on that die. State which die / dice yields the highest probability of obtaining the largest number.

Choices:
- Die C
- Die A
- Dice C and D
- Dice A and D
