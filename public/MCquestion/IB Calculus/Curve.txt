Question: Which of the following statement is correct?

Choices:
- If $f$ has a stationary point at $x=0$, then it must be the case that $f$ has a local extremum at $x=0$.
- If $f'(0) = 0$, then it must be the case that $f$ has a stationary point at $x=0$.
- If $f(0)=0$, then $f'(0)=0$.
- If $f'(0) = 0$, then it must be the case that $f$ has a local maximum or local minimum at $x=0$.
