Question:
Bill and Andrea play two games of tennis. The probability that Bill wins the first game is $\frac{4}{5}$. If Bill wins the first game, the probability that he wins the second game is $\frac{5}{6}$. If Bill loses the first game, the probability that he wins the second game is $\frac{2}{3}$.
(a) Find the probability that Bill wins the first game and Andrea wins the second game. [2]
(b) Find the probability that Bill wins at least one game. [3]
(c) Given that Bill wins at least one game, find the probability that he wins both games. [3]

Solution:

(a)
Probability that Bill wins the first game and Andrea wins the second game = $\frac{4}{5} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{15}$ **A2**

$\ $

(b)
Probability = Probability that Bill wins first game + Probability that Andera wins the first game * Probability that Bill wins the second game
 = $\frac{4}{5} + \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{3}$ **A2**
 = $\frac{14}{15}$ **A1**

$\ $

(c)
Probability that Bill wins both game = $\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3}% **A1**
Conditional probability = $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{14}{15} = \frac{5}{7}$ **A2**

Question:
A bag contains 5 green balls, 3 white balls, and 2 black balls. Three balls are selected at random without replacement.
(a) What is the probability that all balls selected are white? [3]
(b) What is the probability that exactly one of the selected balls is green? [3]
(c) Given the first ball selected is green, the second one selected is white, what is the probability that the last one is black? [3]

Solution:

(a)
Total number of ways of selection: $10C3 = 120$ **A1**
Number of ways to select 3 white balls = $3C3 = 1$ **A1**
Probability = $1 \div 120 = \frac{1}{120}$ **A1**

$\ $

(b)
Number of ways to select 1 green ball = $1C5 \times 2C5 = 50$ **A2**
Probability = $50 \div 120 = \frac{5}{12}$ **A1**

$\ $

(c)
We use ordered probability here.
Probability that all condition satisfied = $5 \times 3 \times 2 \div 10^{(3)} = \frac{1}{24}$ **A1**
Probability that first one green, second one white = $5 \times 3 \times 8 \div 720 = \frac{1}{6}$ **A1**
Probability = $\frac{1}{24} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{4}$ **A1**
Another solution:
Probability that we have 8 balls left, in which there are 2 black balls, and we want to choose one = $2 \div 8 = \frac{1}{4}$

Question:
The letters of the word PROBABILITY are written on 11 cards.
![](/questionPic/prob_1.png?400x)

Two cards are drawn at random without replacement.
Let $A$ be the event the first card drawn is the letter A.
Let $B$ be the event the second card drawn is the letter B.
(a) Find $P(A)$. [1]
(b) Find $P(B|A)$. [2]
(c) Find $P(A \cap BB = )$. [2]

Solution:
(a)
Probability = $1 \div 11 = \frac{1}{11}$ **A1**

$\ $

(b)
Probability that second card is B, given that first card is A 
= Probability that drawn card is B from the 10 remaining cards
= $2 \div 10 = \frac{1}{5}$ **A2**

$\ $
(c)
Note that $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$ **A1**
Probability = $\frac{1}{11} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{55}$ **A1**

Question:
There are 6 fair balls numbered from 1 to 6 in the box. There are 4 students and each one draws a ball from the box.
Balls are put back after the draws.
(a) How many outcomes are there? [1]
(b) What is the probability that all four students drew the same ball? [2]
(c) What is the probability that none draws ball 4? [2]
(d) What is the probability that 2 students draw the same ball, while 2 other students draw another, different ball? [3]

Solution:
(a)
Number of assignments = $6^{4} = 1296$ **A1**

$\ $
(b)
Number of ways that all 4 students get same number = 6 **A1**
Probability = $6 \div 1296 = \frac{1}{216}$ **A1**

$\ $
(c)
Number of ways that all 4 students draw only from ball 1,2,3,5,6 = $5^{4} = 625$ **A1**
Probability = $625 \div 1296 = \frac{625}{1296}$ **A1**

$\ $

(d)
Number of ways to split 4 students into 2 groups of 2 = $4C2 \times 2C2 = 6$ **A1**
Number of ways to assign these 2 groups 2 different number = $6C2 = 15$ **A1**
Probability = $6 \times 15 \div 1296 = \frac{5}{72}$ **A1**

Question:
A total of 300 university students were asked about their opinion about 2 specialization under Mathematics major.
150 of them say they like Pure Mathematics, 125 of them say they like Actuarial Science, and we know 250 of them like at least
one of the specializations.
(a) How many students like both specializations? [2]
(b) What is the probability that a randomly selected student like exactly one specialization? [2]
(c) What is the probability that a randomly selected student like neither specialization? [2]

Solution:
(a)
Let $P$ be the event that a randomly selected student like Pure Mathematics.
Let $A$ be the event that a randomly selected student like Actuarial Science.
Then we know $P(A) = 125 \div 300 = \frac{5}{12}, P(P) = 150 \div 300 = \frac{1}{2}, P(A \cup P) = 250 \div 300 = \frac{5}{6}$
$P(P \cap A) = P(A) + P(B) - P(P \cup A) = \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{12}$ **A1**
So number of such students = $300 \times \frac{1}{12} = 25$ **A1**

$\ $

(b)
Number of students that like exactly one specialization = Number of students like at least one specialization - Number of students like both specialization
= 250 - 25 = 225 **A1**
probability = $225 \div 300 = \frac{3}{4}$ **A1**

$\ $

(c)
Probability = $P(\overline{A} \cap \overline{P}) = P(\overline{A \cup P}) **A1**
= 1 - P(A \cup P) = 1- \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}$  **A1**

Question:
A four-digit number without leading zero is formed by randomly drawing four numbers from 0 ~ 9 without replacement. 
We define $A$ to be the event that the number is even. $B$ to be the event that the number is divisible by 4.
(a) Calculate P(A) [3]
(b) Calculate P(B) [3]

Solution:
(a)
Number of possible numbers = $9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 = 4536$ **A1**
Explanation: For first digit, we can choose from 1 ~ 9, so we have 9 choices. Then we are left with 9 digits to choose from to form the remaining part of the number.

Number of possible even numbers start with odd digit = $5 \times 5 \times 8 \times 7 = 1400$
Number of possible even numbers start with even digit = $4 \times 4 \times 8 \times 7 =896$ **A1**
Explanation: We assign digit to the most significant digit first, then the least significant digit second, after assiging these 2 digits, we satisfied all requirements of number and choose digits freely for middle two digits.

Probability = $(1400 + 896) \div 4536 = \frac{41}{81}$ **A1**

$\ $

(b)
It is really easy to make mistake when calculating this one, so we divide the situation in different cases.
We first deal with 0.
Number of numbers ending with "20, 40, 60, 80, 04, 08" = $8 \times 7 \times 6 = 336$
Number of numbers ending with "12, 16, 32, 36, 52, 56, 72, 76, 92, 96" = $7 \times 7 \times 10 = 490$
Number of numbers ending with "24, 28, 48, 64, 68, 84" = $7 \times 7 \times 6 = 294$
Probability = $(336 + 490 + 294) \div 4536  = \frac{20}{81} $ **A3**

Question:
A large online distributor receives and then sends packages to a warehouse in Toronto either by plane, van, or by transport truck. 
When the distributor receives a package, the probability that a package does not arrive to the Toronto warehouse within 48 hours of receipt of the order is 0.02 if it is sent by plane, 0.1 if it is sent by van, and 0.05 if it is sent by transport truck. 
The distributor sends 60% of its packages by truck, 30% by plane, and 10% by van.
(a) What is the probability that a package does not arrive to the Toronto warehouse within 48 hours? [3]
(b) If a package does not arrive at the Toronto warehouse within 48 hours, what is the probability that it was sent by plane? [3]

Solution:
Let P, V, T denote the event that a randomly selected package is sent by Plane, Van, or Truck respectively. 
Let U denote the event that the package does not arrive Toronto within 48 hours.
We have: $P(U|P) = 0.02, P(U|V) = 0.1, P(U|T) = 0.05, P(P) = 0.03, P(V) = 0.1, P(T) = 0.6$

(a)
Probability = $P(U) = P(UP) + P(UV)+ P(UT)$ **A1**
= $P(U|P) \times P(P) + P(U|V) \times P(V) + P(U|T) \times P(T)$ **A1**
= 0.046 **A1**

$\ $
(b)
Probability = $P(P|U) = \frac{P(UP)}{P(U)} $ **A1**
= $P(U|P) \times P(P) \div P(U)$ **A1**
= \frac{3}{23} **A1**

Question:
Tests used to diagnose medical conditions are often imperfect, and give false positive or false negative results. 
A relatively inexpensive blood test for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) has the following characteristics: the false negative rate is 2% and the false positive rate is 0.5%. 
It is assumed that 0.04% of Canadian males are infected with HIV. 
Find the probability that if a male tests positive for HIV, he actually has HIV. [4]

Solution:
Define the events $A$ = “selected male has HIV” and $B$ = “blood test is positive”. The probability we want to calculate is $P(A|B)$.
And we know: $P(B|A) = 0.98, P(B|\overline{A}) = 0.005, P(A) =0.0004$. **A2**

From Bayes's Rule, we know $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(A)P(B|A)+P(\overline{A})P(B|\overline{A})}$ **A1**
$= \frac{(0.0004)(0.98)}{(0.0004)(0.98)+(0.9996)(0.005)}$
$= \frac{196}{2695}$ **A1**

Question:
Abby, Barry, and Cindy are students who each independently answer a question on a test. 
The probability of getting the correct answer is 0.9 for Abby, 0.7 for Barry, and 0.4 for Cindy. 
If two of them get the correct answer, what is the probability that Cindy was the one with the incorrect answer? [3]

Solution:
Let A, B, and C denote the events that the test question is answered correctly by Abby, Barry, and Cindy, respectively. 
We also define the event D = “two of the three students get the correct answer”.
$P(D) = P(AB\overline{c})+ P(A\overline{B}C) + P(\overline{A}BC) = 0.9 \times 0.7 \times 0.6 + 0.9 \times 0.3 \times 0.4 + 0.1 \times 0.7 \times 0.4 = 0.514$ **A1**
Then we have $P(\overline{C}|D)= \frac{P(AB\overline{C})}{P(D)} = \frac{0.9 \times 0.7 \times 0.6}{0.514} = \frac{189}{257}$ **A1**

Question:
Consider a group of six third-year undergraduate students and seven fourth-year undergraduate students. 
Suppose that among the group of third-year students is one student whose first name is Roger. 
A committee of size five is randomly formed.
(a) Find the probability of the event A = "the third-year student named Roger is included on the committee" [2]
(b) Find the probability of the event B = "the committee is comprised only of fourth-year students" [2]
(c) Find the probability of the event C = "at most four of the committee members are from third year" [2]

Solution:
Number of ways to form the committee = $\binom{13}{5} = 1287$ 
(a)
Number of ways to select Roger, and then select 4 other students = $1 \times \binom{12}{4} = 495$ **A1**
$P(A) = 495 \div 1287 = \frac{5}{13}$

$\ $

(b)
Number of ways to choose 5 students from fourth year = $\binom{7}{5} = 21$ **A1**
$P(B) = 21 \div 1287 = \frac{7}{429}$ **A1**

$\ $

(c)
Number of ways that all 5 students are from third year = $\binom{6}{5} = 6$ **A1**
$P(C) = 1 - \frac{6}{1287} = \frac{427}{429}$ **A1**

Question:
Suppose a box contains ten balls of which three are red, four are white, and three are green. 
A sample of four balls is selected at random without replacement.
Find the Probability of the following events:
(a) A = “the sample contains 2 red balls” [2]
(b) B = “the sample contains 2 red balls, 1 white ball, and 1 green ball” [2]
(c) C = “the sample contains 2 or more red balls” [2]

Solution:
Imagine that we label the balls from 1 to 10 with labels 1, 2, 3 representing red, 
labels 4, 5, 6, 7 representing white, and labels 8, 9, 10 representing green.
Total number of possible outcomes = $\binom{10}{4} = 210$

(a)
$P(A) = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \binom{7}{2}}{210} = \frac{3}{10}$ **A2**

$\ $

(b)
$P(B) = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \binom{4}{1} \binom{3}{1}}{210} = \frac{6}{35}$ **A2**

$\ $

(c)
P(C) = Probability that there are 2 red balls + probability that there are 3 red balls 
= $\frac{\binom{3}{2} \binom{7}{2} +  \binom{3}{3} \binom{7}{1}}{210} = \frac{1}{3}$

Question:
A football team, Melchester Rovers are playing a tournament of five matches.
The probabilities that they win, draw or lose a match are $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{6}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ respectively.
These probabilities remain constant; the result of a match is independent of the results of other matches. 
At the end of the tournament their coach Roy loses his job if they lose three consecutive matches, 
otherwise he does not lose his job. Find the probability that Roy loses his job. [4]

Solution:
Note Roy loses his job if they lose three CONSECUTIVE matches, not no less than 3 matches after finishing all 5 mathces.
Let A be the event that Roy lost first 3 matches, B be that Roy did not lose the first game, but lost game 2,3,4, C be that Roy did not lose game 2 but lost 3,4,5.
$P(A) = (\frac{1}{3})^{3} = \frac{1}{27}$ **A1**
$P(B) = \frac{2}{3} \times (\frac{1}{3})^{3} = \frac{2}{81}$ **A1**
$P(C) = 1 \times \frac{2}{3} \times (\frac{1}{3})^{3} = \frac{2}{81}$ **A1**
Probability = $\frac{1}{27} + \frac{2}{81} + \frac{2}{81} = \frac{7}{81}$ **A1**
